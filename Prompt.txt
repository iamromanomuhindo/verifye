Project Overview

We need to build a custom email validation API that achieves at least 99% accuracy. The service should be production-grade—comparable to providers like Mailgun or Twilio—but built entirely in-house using Node.js. It must use a multi-layered approach (syntax validation, DNS/MX checks, disposable email detection, and optional SMTP heuristics) to verify email addresses without relying on third-party APIs.

Technical Requirements

Language & Framework:

Use Node.js with Express as the primary framework.
Follow modern JavaScript practices (ES6+).
Validation Layers:

Syntax Validation:
Implement robust, RFC 5322-compliant regex logic (or helper module) to validate email format.
DNS & MX Record Verification:
Use Node’s native dns module (with promises) to perform DNS lookups and verify MX records for the email domain. Optionally, check for A records if no MX records are found.
Disposable/Role-Based Email Detection:
Maintain a curated list of disposable and role-based domains (stored in a local file or module) and flag these emails.
SMTP Verification (Optional):
Develop an optional, low-impact SMTP check using Node’s net module. The check should issue minimal commands (EHLO, MAIL FROM) without completing the full handshake to avoid being flagged.
Heuristic & Typo Correction:
Incorporate common typo detection (e.g., “gamil.com” for “gmail.com”) and offer suggestions.
User Confirmation (Optional):
Design the system so that an email verification token can be sent to the user. Mark the email as “fully validated” only when the user confirms it.
Security & Performance:

Use rate limiting (via middleware like express-rate-limit) to prevent abuse.
Validate all incoming input thoroughly to mitigate injection attacks.
Cache DNS/MX lookup results where possible to improve performance.
Use environment variables (via a package like dotenv) for configuration and secret management.
Error Handling & Logging:

Implement centralized error handling middleware.
Set up professional logging (e.g., using Winston) to record API usage and errors.
Testing:

Develop a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests using Jest or Mocha.
Ensure tests cover a wide range of email scenarios (valid, invalid, edge cases).
Documentation:

Generate clear API documentation (e.g., using Swagger or similar tools) to detail endpoints, request/response formats, and error codes.
Proposed Project Structure

Create a modular project structure to separate concerns and ensure maintainability:

Detailed Task Breakdown

Server Initialization (server.js):

Load environment variables.
Set up Express with JSON parsing.
Configure API versioning (e.g., /api/v1/email).
Attach routes and global error handler.
Listen on the defined port.
API Routes (routes/emailRoutes.js):

Define a POST endpoint /validate that accepts a JSON payload with an email field.
Ensure routes are modular to allow future expansion (e.g., health checks, token confirmation endpoints).
Controller Logic (controllers/emailController.js):

Validate incoming request payloads.
Delegate email validation to the service layer.
Return structured JSON responses (success status, detailed validation messages, and additional data such as MX records).
Core Validation Service (services/emailValidator.js):

Implement syntax validation using a robust regex.
Use the DNS module to perform MX record lookups and handle errors gracefully.
Check the email domain against the curated list of disposable/role-based domains.
Optionally call the SMTP verification service.
Return a unified result structure with flags for each validation step.
Optional SMTP Checker (services/smtpChecker.js):

If implemented, use Node’s net module to connect to the email server.
Send minimal SMTP commands and interpret responses without completing a full handshake.
Return heuristic results without risking IP blacklisting.
Utility Modules (utils/regexValidator.js & disposableDomains.js):

In regexValidator.js, store and export a robust regular expression for email validation.
In disposableDomains.js, export an array of disposable and role-based email domains. Ensure this list is easy to update.
Middleware (middlewares/errorHandler.js & rateLimiter.js):

Global error handler to catch and log errors, then return a consistent error response.
Rate limiting middleware to throttle requests and secure the API.
Testing (tests/emailValidator.test.js):

Write tests to cover all validation layers:
Valid emails
Invalid syntax
Domains with no MX records
Emails from disposable domains
Edge cases and common typos
Ensure both unit and integration tests are in place to verify the overall system functionality.
Documentation & Deployment:

Create API documentation detailing each endpoint, input requirements, response formats, and error handling.
Prepare deployment scripts and ensure the configuration is production-ready with proper environment variables and logging.
Final Deliverable

A fully functional, production-ready email validation API system built in Node.js that:

Implements multiple validation layers (syntax, DNS/MX, disposable email detection, optional SMTP checks).
Is organized into a modular structure with clear separation of concerns.
Includes security features such as rate limiting and proper error handling.
Provides extensive unit and integration test coverage.
Offers comprehensive API documentation for external developers.
